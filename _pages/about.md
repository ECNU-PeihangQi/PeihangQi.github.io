I'm a student from [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.ecnu.edu.cn/) at [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include AI-generated content (AIGC), with a focus on music generation and image generation, exploring machine learning techniques for creative applications.
